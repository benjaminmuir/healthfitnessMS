ORDER OF DOING THINGS AS OF 4/11/24:

    NEED TO DO ADMIN MENU SO THAT WE CAN CREATE ROOMS, SESSIONS, CLASSES

    FOR CLASSES: ADMIN CREATES AND ASSIGNS TRAINER -> MEMBERS REGISTER (USING memberClasses junction table)

    FOR ROOMS: ADMINS CREATE -> ADMIN ASSIGN EVENT TO ROOM + DATA OF ROOM 

    FOR SESSION: MEMBERS CREATES -> MEMBERS REGISTER (ONE TO ONE) I.E MEMBER UNIQUE AND TRAINER UNIQUE -> QUERY AND CHECK IF TRAINER CAN
        ROOMS NOT UNIQUE BECAUSE WE CAN HAVE MULTIPLE THINGS IN ONE ROOM 
    FLOW OF SESSIONS:
        USERS GOES TO SCHEDULE MENU -> CREATE SCHEDULE BUTTON -> SCHEDULE CREATION IS STARTED -> SID MADE (SERIAL) -> ASKS WHAT TRAINER ->
        TRAINER IS PICKED -> TRAINER SCHEDULE IS PRINTED -> ASKS WHAT TIME AND DAY -> CHECKS FOR TIME AND DAY VS TRAINER SCHEDULE (CAN USE HELPFUL HINT AT BOTTOM) ->
        IF NOT AVAILABLE -> ASK FOR DAY AND TIME AGAIN (ROLLBACK) -> OTHERWISE -> SCHEDULE THE SESSION

    SCHEDULE CLASS:
        WILL LOOK LIKE THIS: 
            TRAINER ID:      DAY:
            1               Monday
            1               Wednesday
            2               Thursday
            2               Tuesday
        I.E Trainers ID will be linked (FK) and they specify which day they can work 
        He does not specify a time in the comment he made, so maybe don't need (they are avaiable all day)
        *MAYBE MAKE SO ALL EVENTS CAN ONLY OCCUR BETWEEN CERTAIN TIMES* *OPEN AND CLOSED GYM*

    HELPFUL HINT: 
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM session
    WHERE trainer_id = %s AND (
        (time_start <= %s AND time_end > %s) OR
        (time_start < %s AND time_end >= %s) OR
        (time_start >= %s AND time_end <= %s)
    )
    HERE IS A QUERY THAT WILL BE RUN WHEN A SESSION IS MADE, CHECKING IF THERE ARE ANY SESSIONS OVERLAPPING WITH THE CURRENT ONE


    DIFFERENT FLOW FOR HELP:
        CLASS: CLASS MUST BE MADE FIRST (TRAINER + ROOM ASSIGNED) -> THEN MEMBER CAN JOIN 
        SESSION: MEMBER MUST CREATE FIRST -> THEN MADE
        ROOMS: ROOM MUST BE MADE FIRST -> THEN EVENT SCHEDULE IS DETERMINED -> THEN
