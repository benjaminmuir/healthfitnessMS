Set up schduling system:
    Once member display information is done we need to set up scheduling. 
    This means the trainer implementation needs to be half done, need all scheduling related 
    functionality to be finished. 

    One major change: 
        Rooms - Rooms will be involved in all scheduling of sessions or group fitness class 
        rooms must be available, and thus will need to be assigned to specific class/events/sessions 





Admin staff:
    Need to set up rooms:
        Rooms will be involved the event management and thus they will need to be assigned 
        events?
